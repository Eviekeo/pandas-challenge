# pandas-challenge
As part of my submission for Module 4 - Pandas DataFrames Challenge, I have submitted a Jupyter notebook titled "Module 4 Challenge" in the "PyCitySchools" file, where I have analysed school and standardised test data. I have also submitted my written report through this README.

# Written Report

Summary

In this analysis, we have analysed 15 schools (8 independent, 7 government), with data on reading and maths scores, size of schools and school budgets. We have used this data to determine how a student's performance in maths, reading and overall performance is impacted by the type of school attended (government vs independent), school budget, school size and school type. The below conclusions have been drawn from the data:

Conclusions

  School performance: Independent schools typically outperform government schools. This conclusion can be drawn by analysing the 5 lowest performing schools, where 4/5 are government schools and 1/5 is an independent school, and by analysing the passing rate by school type. This can be attributed to improved amenities and student support at independent schools.
  
  Impact of school size on student performance: Based on the data analysed, we can conclude that school size can negatively impact student performance. The average passing rate for small schools (<1000) is higher than for medium sized schools (1000-2000) and large sized schools (2000-5000). The average passing rate for large sized schools was the worst compared to small and medium sized schools. This can be attributed to less student support available to larger sized schools as a result of scarce resources.
